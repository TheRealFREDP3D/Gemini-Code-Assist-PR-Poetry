# Compilation of Gemini PR Poetry

## Why?

When a Pull Request is created, the **Gemini Code Assist** app analyzes it and generates a detailed report.  
But tucked at the end of that reportâ€¦ a surprising flourish:

A snippet of poetry â€” inspired by the PR itself.

It took me off guard. For a moment I wondered:  
**"This is a weird featureâ€¦ why?"**

But maybe weird is good. Maybe it's beautiful.
