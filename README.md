# Gemini Code Assist PR Poetry

## Why?

When a Pull Request is created, the **Gemini Code Assist** app analyzes it and generates a detailed report.
But tucked at the end of that reportâ€¦ a surprising flourish:

A snippet of poetry â€” inspired by the PR itself.

It took me off guard. For a moment I wondered:
**"This is a weird featureâ€¦ why?"**

I know it's weird...  
But maybe weird is good.  
Maybe it's beautiful.

### Automated Collection

You can use the `get_new_flowers.py` script to automatically collect poems from GitHub repositories:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install requests gitpython tqdm litellm

# Set your GitHub token (will work without it but recommended to avoid rate limits)
# It's free to get one from https://github.com/marketplace/a
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Basic usage - collect from this repository
python get_new_flowers.py

# Search for poems across multiple public repositories
python get_new_flowers.py --search --max-repos=10

# See all options
python get_new_flowers.py --help
```

### Configuration

The script can be configured using environment variables in a `.env` file:

```env
# Default LLM
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Fallback LLM
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Optional LiteLLM Logging (uncomment to enable)
# LITELLM_LOGGING=True
# LITELLM_LOG=DEBUG
```

### Key Features

- Collects poems from any public GitHub repository
- Adds new poems to the top of the file (LIFO order)
- Avoids duplicates
- Includes metadata about the source repository and PR
- Uses LLM models to identify poems in comments
- Automatically falls back to alternative models when rate limits are encountered
- Logs detailed information about the collection process
- Supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure, Gemini, Ollama, etc.)

### Output Formats

- **Markdown**: Human-readable format in `gem-flowers.md`
- **JSON**: Machine-readable format in `gem-flowers.json`

```bash
# Specify a repository to check
python get_new_flowers.py --owner="username" --repo="repository"

# Limit the number of PRs to check
python get_new_flowers.py --max-prs=20
